# Bangla-Sign-Language-Detection
Bangla Sign Language Recognition using Transfer Learning with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

The purpose of this study is to identify and understand the specific gestures used by deaf
and hard-of-hearing people in Bangladesh. It is also a prominent and rapidly developing
field. This work proposes a unique convolutional neural network-based technique for real-
time Bangla Sign Language identification from static input data. Here we have used the
YOLO v5 model which has never been applied to detect Bangla Sign Language. It turned
out to be one of the most effective techniques for finding things in real-time. A mean
average precision of 0.916% and a satisfactory overall performance were obtained using
YOLO v5 model. We believe it will have a substantial effect on the detection of Bangla
sign language. In addition, people will be able to comprehend the language of the deaf and
dumb community and communicate with them easily with the help of this study. Also,
we may avoid the interpreter issue with the help of this work.
